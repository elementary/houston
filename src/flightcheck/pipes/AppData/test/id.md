Missing AppStream id

AppCenter requires the AppStream id to provided and must match your RDNN (com.github.username.repo.desktop). Please provide an id and match it to your RDNN.

For more information, please look at the
[appstream documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html).
