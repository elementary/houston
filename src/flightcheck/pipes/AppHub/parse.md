Create a readable apphub file

Congratulations, you successfully have a `.apphub` file! Well, not quite. It
seems we ran into problems trying to parse it.

Here is the error we received when trying to parse it:
```
{{ data }}
```

If you need a short refresher on JSON, here is a simple example file:
```
{
  "log": {
    "label": "AppCenter"
  }
}
```
