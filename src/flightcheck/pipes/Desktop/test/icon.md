Missing Desktop Icon

AppCenter requires the `Icon` to be set in the desktop file.
It must match `{{ data }}`.

For more information, please look at the
[elementary Documentation](https://elementary.io/docs/code/getting-started#the-desktop-file) and the
[freedesktop Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html).
