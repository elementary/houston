Create a desktop file

In order for your application to be fully accessible on the desktop, you will
need to provide a desktop file named `{{ data }}` and insure it gets installed
in `/usr/share/applications`. This file lets everyone know what icon to use,
what file to run, and any alternative actions that can be ran.
