> Houston is currently undergoing a rewrite to typescript with an emphasis on
testability. Currently, the only part used in production for v2 is the worker
process. Everything else will be found in the master branch.

Houston is part of AppCenter, a multi component system for helping developers
and making users' life easier. Houston includes processes for building, testing,
and publishing packages, as well as the front end website.

For more information about the architecture and processes that make up Houston
please see the [architecture
file](https://github.com/elementary/houston/blob/v2/ARCHITECTURE.md).

For development information see the [various readme
files](https://github.com/elementary/houston/blob/v2/src/README.md) in the
`src/` directory.

For building and setting up your own instance read the
[install file](https://github.com/elementary/houston/blob/v2/INSTALL.md).
