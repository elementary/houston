AppCenter Dashboard (codenamed "houston") is part of AppCenter, a
multi-component system for making developers’ and end users’ lives easier.

Think of AppCenter Dashboard as your personal assistant when it comes to app
development for elementary OS. Just push your code to a GitHub repository and
let AppCenter Dashboard test, build, give a second look, and publish your app to
users on AppCenter. Little to no configuration needed.
