Houston is part of AppCenter, a multi component system for making developers and
end users life easier.

Think of Houston as your personal assistant when it comes to elementary
application development. Just push your code to a GitHub repository and let
Houston test, build, give a second look, and publish your application on
AppCenter. Little to no configuration needed.
