## Issues

If you find an issue or bug with Houston or any of it's appHooks, please submit
an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/elementary/houston/issues/new). To help
clear confusion and increase productivity, here are some general rules to follow
when submitting an issue.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** that identifies the problem.
* **Include steps to reproduce** the issue so developers can test solutions.
Even the simplest step is sometimes the cause.
* **Include details about your application**. This helps developers identify if
the issue is only for your application, or for others. This may include links to
GitHub repositories or issues.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered** describe what you were doing before the
problem occurred.
* **Explain what you expected to happen**. Even if it's super obvious.

## Coding

Pull requests are the best way to see an issue fixed or a feature you want added
to Houston. To keep the code clean, and friendly for everyone we have setup some
rules you should follow before submitting, all of which are avalible on our
[wiki page](https://github.com/elementary/houston/wiki).
